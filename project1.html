            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p class="project-description">
                In this project, I designed a basic communication system consisting of a transmitter and
                receiver that is capable of processing an input signal through an amplitude modulator and
                transmitting it through a medium. The process that i use in modulating and demodulating
                the signal is very similar to the process of standard AM radio transmission! </p>
            
                <h4> Transmitter </h4>
                <p class="project-description"> For a communication system, there are many possible transmitter types. For
                the sake of simplicity, I designed an AM transmitter that performs Double-Sideband Large Carrier (DSB-LC) modulation. 
                This transmitter takes an audio signal, mixes it with a modulating sinusoid, and adds a large high-frequency
                carrier to create a DSB-LC signal. Mixer circuits and summer circuits are important to design and configure 
                throughout the scope of this project. 
                
                <p class="project-description"> The signal will also have to be amplified to a
                sufficiently large level for transmission. For this, an active filter between 150
                to 15kHz (the range of normal human hearing) was necessary to design. </p>
                
                <h4> Receiver </h4> 
                <p class="project-description"> To receive this signal, I use an envelope detector consisting of a diode and
                    an RC circuit to recover the envelope of the DSB-LC signal, which contains
                    the demodulated original signal. The received signal will have to be amplified 
                    from a smaller signal level, and an amplifier between the frequencies 150 Hz to
                    15kHz will be necessary for a significant output to be detected. Finally, this
                    received signal must be output through a speaker in order to reproduce the sound 
                    originally input into the transmitter. </p>

            <h2> Methods </h2>
            <p class="project-description"> 
                Throughout the implementation of this project, I faced
                many problems and found several interesting solutions. The first step the design 
                was in creating a useful transmitter, capable of generating and modulating an audio
                signal. For this transmitter, I first designed an astable 555-timer to generate
                a test signal of a 1kHz square wave. This signal could be triggered with a
                push-button connected to the reset pin.

                <p class="project-description"> 
                    Aside from the 555-timer signal for testing, a small electret microphone was also used as the input device, capturing audio 
                    signals from a headphone speaker that was placed next to it. Using the microphone, these analog signals are converted to electrical signals.

            <p class="project-description">
                The electrical signals are then fed into an amplitude modulator. The modulator multiplies the input signal with a carrier signal of frequency 100kHz, resulting in an amplitude-modulated signal.

                Once the signal is received, it is fed into an envelope detector, which demodulates 
                the signal. This component uses a diode and LC circuit to remove the carrier signal,
                leaving only the original audio signal.

                Finally, the demodulated signal is fed into an audio amplifier to ensure that it's strong enough to drive a speaker. The speaker converts the electrical signals back into audio signals, reproducing the original sound.

            <h2> Results </h2>
            <p class="project-description">
                The resulting circuit was capable of transmitting and receiving the audio signals
                over a very short distance. In order to increase the distance of the transmission,
                an increase in the power of the transmitter would increase the distance that the
                waves would transmit. However, because the carrier frequency I used, 100kHz,
                is a lower frequency, there is a potential issue that the low frequency waves could
                propogate over large distances. As a result, it was necessary to limit the power
                to very-low wattage. The final circuit put together can be seen in the images below,
                with the transmitter and receiver:
