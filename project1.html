            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p class="project-description">
                In today's world, efficient and effective communication systems are more necessary than ever before. 
                Billions of devices communicate with each other in an interconnected network that   
                dominates the natural sphere. WiFi routers, radio broadcasts, and weather radars are able to seamlessly transmit 
                information across space and time. 
            </p>
            <p class="project-description">
                But how does it all work? 
            </p>
            <p class="project-description">
                The short answer is only one word -- <em>"Modulation."</em> 
            </p>
            <p class="project-description">
                The objective of this project was to gain an understanding of radio
                communications by studying one specific type of modulation -- <em>Amplitude Modulation</em> (AM)
            </p>
            <h2>Materials</h2>
            <p class="project-description">
                The primary components involved in the process are a microphone, an LM386 audio amplifier, an operational amplifier, a 2N222A MOSFET transistor, a speaker, and passive elements such as resistors, inductors, and capacitors.            </p>
            </p>
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p class="project-description">
                In this project, I designed a basic communication system consisting of a transmitter and
                receiver that is capable of processing an input signal through an amplitude modulator and
                transmitting it through a medium. The process in modulating and demodulating
                the signal is very similar to the process of standard AM radio transmission. </p>
            
                <h4> Transmitter </h4>
                <p class="project-description">
                    For a communication system, there are many possible<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation">
                    modulation types. </a>
                    For the sake of simplicity, I designed an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude_modulation">Amplitude Modulating (AM) </a> transmitter that performs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideband">Double-Sideband</a> Large Carrier (DSB-LC) modulation.
                <p class="project-description">    
                    This transmitter takes an audio signal, mixes it with a modulating sinusoid, and adds a large high-frequency
                    carrier to create a DSB-LC signal. Mixer circuits and summer circuits are important to design and configure
                    throughout the scope of this project.
                </p>

                <p class="project-description"> After modAulation, the signal will have to be amplified to a
                sufficiently large level for transmission. For this, an amplifier was designed using a 2N222A MOSFET transistor. </p>

                <h4> Receiver </h4>
                <p class="project-description"> To receive this signal, I use an envelope detector consisting of a diode and
                    an RC circuit to recover the envelope of the DSB-LC signal, which contains
                    the demodulated original signal. The received signal must be amplified from its initial small signal level,
                    necessitating an amplifier effective within the audio frequencies of 150 Hz to 15 kHz. Finally, this
                    received signal must be output through a speaker in order to reproduce the sound
                    originally input into the transmitter. </p>

            <h2> Methods </h2>
            <p class="project-description">
                Throughout the implementation of this project, I encountered many challenges, which prompted several innovative solutions. 
            </p>
            <p class="project-description">
                The first step in the design
                was in creating a useful transmitter, capable of generating and modulating an audio
                signal. For this transmitter, I first designed an astable 555-timer to generate
                a test signal of a 1kHz square wave. This signal could be manually triggered using a push-button connected to the reset pin.
            </p>
            <h4> 555 Timer Circuit to Generate Test Signal </h4>

            </p>
            <p class="project-description">
                Aside from the 555-timer signal for testing, a small electret microphone was also used as the input device, capturing audio
                signals from a headphone speaker that was placed next to it. Using the microphone, these analog signals are converted to electrical signals.

            <p class="project-description">
                The electrical signals are then fed into an amplitude modulator. The modulator multiplies the input signal with a carrier signal of frequency 100kHz, resulting in an amplitude-modulated signal.

            <h2>Demodulator</h2>
            <p class="project-description">
                Once the signal is received, it is fed into an envelope detector, which demodulates 
                the signal. This component uses a diode and LC circuit to remove the carrier signal,
                leaving only the original audio signal.

                Finally, the demodulated signal is fed into an audio amplifier, which strengthens 
                the signal enough to drive a speaker. The speaker then converts these electrical 
                signals back into sound, effectively reproducing the original audio.

            <h2> Results </h2>
            <p class="project-description">
                The resulting circuit successfully transmitted and received audio signals over a 
                short distance. To increase the transmission distance, boosting the power of the 
                transmitter would be required. However, the carrier frequency I used, 100kHz, could 
                propagate over long distances due to its lower frequency nature, which necessitated 
                a limitation on the power to very low wattage. The final circuit put together can 
                be seen in the images below.
