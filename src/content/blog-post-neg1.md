## Introduction
The problem of chess has been one of the earliest tasks in machine learning. Researchers such as Alan Turing and Claude Shannon had both published papers on computers chess algorithms in the early days of computing. 

In modern times, chess is still unsolved. In fact, it is very likely unsolveable.
But computers are much better at solving the problem than humans...And they use a model of human intuition to do it.
