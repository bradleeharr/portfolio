## On Low, Medium, and High Density Parity Check Codes"

Modern 4G and 5G communications often uses a set of error-correcting codes known as "Low-Density Parity Check" (LDPC) Codes. 

The short of the process is that bits of redundancy, called parity bits, are added to input data. Some bits of your initial message may get corrupted and flipped, but the parity bits, along with the bits that did not get flipped, are probably able to provide enough information to still convey the message error-free.
