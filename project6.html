            <h2> Introduction </h2>
            <p class="project-description">
                Computer chess engines are computer systems designed to generate solutions for the problem of playing a game of chess. The most powerful engines have already achieved powerful performance using human-like learning through neural networks and reinforcement learning. However, while chess engines are capable of making the best moves, many chess engines will suggest moves that a human would never play because of the computerâ€™s ability to calculate with precision and accuracy. This may make it more of a challenge for humans to learn from the results of a chess engine when using it to train or better understand the game of chess.
                <br/><br/>
                One example of an existing attempt to create a specifically human-like chess AI is Maia Chess [1] [2], an engine trained on 12 million human games to perform more human-like movement prediction.
                <br/><br/>
                The goal of my project was to explore using deep learning approaches to capture personal human style from several hundreds of chess games played by an individual person. One differing approach I used in comparison to Maia was in using a much smaller set of personal games as well as including shorter-time games in my data. This was necessary because of the lack of games I had in my personal database, but it makes an important distinction, considering the problem of capturing human decision-making style in shorter time frames.
            </p>
            <h2> Data </h2>
            <p class="project-description">
                The first step to addressing the problem was to acquire individual game datasets. Many databases of thousands to millions of games are available, but for my project I wanted to try to use personal games. This both keeps the results highly individual and limits the dataset to a small amount (~2,000 games), capable for processing and training on only an AMD Ryzen CPU with no GPU acceleration. Other attempts to create AI to predict human move predictions in chess and other games typically filter their data to remove very short time format chess games. For example, in Maia, Hyper-Bullet (30 seconds or less per player) and Bullet (1-2 minutes per player) format games were filtered out [1], and in the training of the original AlphaGo model, only professional games from master-level players were used [3]. To use the most data available to me, I decided to include all my personal games, which includes 1,633 Bullet games, 165 Blitz (3-8 minutes per player) games, and 244 Rapid (10-15 minutes per player) games.
                <br/><br/>
                Heavily including many Bullet games applies more focus on the impulsive reactions and emotions that arise in low-time scenarios and can be useful to capture and model human behavior in short-time scenarios. The diversity of including the different time formats also has a potential benefit that helps focus on capturing the full scope of play. Given the highly complex nature of predicting chess moves in a time-sensitive context, the data was quite limited. Nevertheless, I strived to obtain meaningful results by trying different architectures.
                <br/><br/>
                From every game, each board position and move choice made by the specified player was converted data inputs for each model. The data was split into train, validation, and test sets with a 75-15-15 split.
            </p>
            <h2> Methods </h2>
            <p class="project-description">
                3.0 Board Features:
                Each position of every game was transformed into an 8x8x12 map. The 8x8 area corresponds to the chess board itself, and each channel of area 8x8 corresponds to one piece. Since there are 12 different pieces, 12 channels are needed. A 1 is placed in a square if a piece is present and a 0 if a piece is not present
                <br/><br/>

                3.1 Move Features:
                <br/><br/>

                Each move of every game was converted from the Universal Chess Interface format to a number based on the square that the move is from (1-64) and the square that the move is going to (1-64). This results in 64 x 64 combinations, or 4096 classes.
                <br/><br/>

                3.2 Random Valid Move Model:
                <br/><br/>

                For a baseline metric to compare results for move prediction accuracy, this model selects a random move for each position. The random valid move choices resulted in an accuracy of 3.1-3.6%.

            <h2>Machine Learning Model</h2>
            <p class="project-description">
                To achieve this, a machine learning model was trained on a vast dataset of historical games from Lichess. The model used features like the position of the pieces on the board, past moves, and potential future moves. This training enabled the AI to recognize patterns and trends in human players' strategies and mimic them in its gameplay.

                The trained machine learning model was then integrated into the Chess AI. With each move it makes, the AI analyzes the current state of the game and the potential outcomes of various moves, predicting the most likely successful move based on the machine learning model's insights.

            <p class="project-description">
                The final step involved rigorous testing and evaluation of the Chess AI. The AI played against various styles and levels of players, successfully emulating human playing styles and displaying a high level of strategic gameplay.
