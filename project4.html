                <h2> Background </h2>


                <h6> Image Quality Assessment </h6>
                The idea of an objective image quality assessment 
                has been an ongoing problem in image processing. A metric 
                that can define an objective quality of an image is very 
                convenient to measure useful properties of an image quickly 
                and effectively. 
                <br/><br/>
                This type of analysis can be used to 
                optimize and benchmark the performance of an assortment 
                of algorithms and image processing methods in the field of 
                digital image processing. Unfortunately, image quality 
                assessment is a very difficult problem to solve, and many 
                attempts at solving image quality assessment result in 
                statistically indistinguishable results.
                <br/><br/>
                <h6> Stereo Imaging </h6>
                Stereoscopic imaging uses multiple perspectives of a single scene, giving it an 
                additional ability to detect the distance between the imaging 
                device and the imaged object. Using stereoscopic imaging can 
                perform at high levels in object detection, ranging, and 
                computer vision tasks within a wide variety of applications. 
                <br/><br/>
                One prominent example is in autonomous vehicles, where stereo cameras 
                can be used improve the detection capabilities of a self-driving vehicle.
                <a href="https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3">ORB-SLAM3</a> is one example
                of an open-source library for this use case, which includes stereo capabilities.
                <br/><br/>
                <h4> Problem </h4>
                The goal of this project is to develop a blind image quality assessment algorithm
                for use within stereoscopic images based on natural statistics 
                found within the composition of the stereo images.

                For this project, I examined the background of stereoscopic 
                imaging and analyzed metrics of luminance and spectral characeristics
                with the goal of estimating visual quality. 
                <br/><br/>
                I used the 
                <a href="https://ivc.uwaterloo.ca/database/3DIQA.html"> Waterloo IVC 3D Image Quality Database </a>
                 to obtain stereo images and image quality information. This dataset contains high quality stereo 
                image pairs, some of which are subject to symmetric or asymmetric distortions. Each image pair is annotated with 
                a mean-opinion-score (MOS) gathered from subjective human ratings. 
                <br/> <br/>

            <h2>Dataset</h2>
            <p class="project-description">
                I first examined and qualified stereo images using 
                MATLAB. I based this work using the publications and 
                images provided by the Waterloo IVC 3D Image Quality 
                Database.
                <br/><br/>
                The Waterloo IVC 3D Image Quality Database
                Phase II is a database with over 460 stereoscopic image 
                pairs that have been made from ten very high-quality 
                stereoscopic images, with varying amounts of distortion, 
                including asymmetric distortions between the stereo image 
                pairs.

            <h2>Fourier Analysis</h2>
            <p class="project-description">
                Fourier analysis was the first method I utilized for assessing the quality of stereo images. 
                It involves analyzing the frequency components of the images and comparing the mean-squared error
                differences between the FFTs of the left and right image pairs to determine quality discrepancies.

            <h2>Gabor Transform</h2>
            <p class="project-description">
                Next, I employed the Gabor transform, a technique used to analyze the spatial frequency content in localized regions of the stereo images. This gave further insights into localized discrepancies and details that might not be noticeable at a global level.

            </div>
            <p class="project-description">
                A filter bank of sixteen Gabor filters was chosen with 
                wavelengths ùúÜ = 4,8,16 and orientations ùúÉ = 0,30,60 as 
                seen in Figures 3 and 4.
                After the image was filtered by several Gabor filters, I 
                took local sums of the Gabor filtered image and calculated 
                the sum of all the values in the Gabor filtered image, divided 
                by a scaling factor. From a set of 100 sample images from 
                the IVC 3D Image Database, I found that this total 
                fit a parabolic curve with an R2 value of 0.10, indicating a 
                mild association. The association between the MOS and this 
                metric can be seen in the graph below.

                Lastly, I used luminance and contrast metrics to measure the perceived brightness and contrast in different parts of the stereo images. This accounts for perceptual aspects of visual quality assessment, completing a comprehensive evaluation of the stereo image quality.

                Ultimately, the resulting algorithm for blindly calculating the image quality had only a minor association with the 
                final image. Below is a comparison between 50 images for different image quality evaluators.
